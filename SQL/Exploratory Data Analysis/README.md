# ü§î Why Exploratory Data Analysis?
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analyzing and summarizing datasets to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses using both statistical and visualization techniques. It helps to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within data before applying formal modeling or machine learning algorithms. It is considered to be a foundational step in any data-driven project. <br>

### üóí Different types of EDA
<ul>
  <li>Univariate analysis: Focus is one a single variable using visualization techniques like histograms, box plots and summary statistics (mean, min, max)</li>
  <li>Bivariate analysis: Examines the relationship between two variables using visualization techniques scatter plots, correlation coefficients.</li>
</ul> <br>


### ‚úÖ Benefits of EDA
<ul>
  <li>Ensures data quality & prepares the dataset for advanced analytics projects.</li>
  <li>It can help validate assumptions, test hypothesis and guide the selection of appropriate statistical or machine learning models.</li>
  <li>It can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights</li>
</ul> <br>

# ‚ùóIMPORTANT
<i>Please note that the dataset used in this script is from my data warehouse project that I built found in the "data-engineering-projects" repo.</i>
